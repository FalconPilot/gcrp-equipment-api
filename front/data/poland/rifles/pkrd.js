  description:
`Nicknamed "starzec" (old man, greybeard) by the polish reservists, the PKRD is an upgraded and stardardized version of older rifles (like the british Martini Henry and the Springfield 1863) to fit modern standard of accuracy and firepower initially thought to be used by unexperienced conscripts and as a propaganda tool to consolidate National Unity.

The Starzec can fight toe to toe with modern rifle, but the old man is aging and tends to be stubborn... The PKRD was build en masse and a lot of them are stockpiled in the numerous military armories of Poland.`
